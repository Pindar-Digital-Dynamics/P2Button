# Xiao ESP32-S3 Plus Button Project

This release is based on the **Xiao ESP32-S3 Plus** platform, integrating **LVGL** with a circular **TFT LCD** (GC9A01 driver) for enhanced visual interaction.

The firmware has been optimized at the OS and kernel layers to improve **input responsiveness** over BLE communication.  
A **low-power sleep routine** has also been introduced, significantly increasing battery efficiency without affecting performance.
